      I’m Jucelle. A designer, illustrator, observer and master doodler currently residing in San Francisco Bay Area. I’m easy to get along with and enjoy collaborating with fellow creatives and adventurers. I always equip myself with two trusty Moleskines in hand – one to keep myself on top of things and the other to scribble whatever awesome and not so awesome ideas I may have.

      I enjoy being a creative. Every project that I make is approached with intelligent, thoughtful and well-informed ideations. Most of my work is centered around branding, identities, graphics, packaging and print.

      I’m currently infatuated by watercolors, hand drawn letterforms, textures and organic-style vectors.
