UConn Reads is a reading program launched by the University of Connecticut which aims to bridge the diverse campus community through a dynamic and meaningful campus-wide book discussion.
The approach behind the identity is to capture the evolving manner of which people read in this day and age. The mark reflects the contemporary use of print and digital forms to publish books. The overlapping transparency embodies the notion of both the printed pages of a book as well as the windows on a computer screen.
