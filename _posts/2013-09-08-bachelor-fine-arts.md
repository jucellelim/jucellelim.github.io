The University of Connecticut’s School of Fine Arts & Department of Art +Art History, hosts an annual <br/> exhibition every spring semester to celebrate the graduating Bachelor of Fine Arts students. 

The task is to create an independent yet unifying identity for different groups of students within the six <br/> various concentrations – design, illustration, photography, printmaking, sculpture and painting. Vibrant <br/> colors accompanied by six geometric shapes representing the multiple concentrations are then used to <br/> create a multitude of dynamic patterns, posters and a customized logotype.

To save costs, the posters are perforated to also serve as postcard mailers.
