The goal is to develop a show identity and exhibition materials that will elevate and bring together the works of five graduating students of the University of Connecticut’s Master of Fine Arts Class of 2012.
The design team used the inspiration from the title of the exhibition, “Do Not Disconnect”, to drive all visual and tonal aspects of the creative work. We took the notion of a brochure and creatively transformed it into a multi-functional promotional piece – brochure, poster and postcard – all as a single unit. A stencil typeface was also created to further convey a contemporary, simple and MOMA-esque feel for the exhibition.
